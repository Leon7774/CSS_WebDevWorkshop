# CSS WebDev Workshop 🚀💻✨

Welcome to the **CSS WebDev Workshop**! This project is designed to take you on a journey from basic HTML all the way to modern web development using React and Tailwind CSS. The repository is structured as an interactive, level-by-level workshop. Each level builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and technologies.

## 🪜 The Levels

### Static Examples (The Fundamentals)

- **Level 1: Pure HTML** (`/01-html/index.html`) - Focus on document structure and semantic tags without any styling.
- **Level 2: HTML + CSS** (`/02-css/index.html`) - Adding style, colors, and layout using CSS.
- **Level 3: HTML + CSS + JS** (`/03-js/index.html`) - Introducing interactivity with Vanilla JavaScript.

### React Examples (Modern Web Development)

- **Level 4: Basic React** - Component-based architecture and JSX.
- **Level 5: React + Tailwind** - Styling efficiently using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **Level 6: React Reusability** - The power of mapping over data to create reusable, dynamic components.
- **Level 7: Landing Page Playground** - Putting it all together into a complete, modern, and aesthetically pleasing landing page.

_P.S. There might be a hidden easter egg minigame on the homepage! Can you find it?_ 👀
